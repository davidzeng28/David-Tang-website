		In our capstone project, we took Southeast Machinery Company as an example to discuss the optimization and control of make-to-order production process. In order to improve the manufacturing process of their plastic extruders, our team introduced Microsoft Project to their company and developed an internal project management system by Project VBA. Eventually, we conducted a survey which based on SUS (system usability scale) for understanding user experience and for further modification.</div>

			<li>Southern Machinery is willing to implement our system in the manufacturing process in the future</li>
			<li>Southern Machinery has difficulty quickly understanding how to use this system. Our team, therefore, wrote a user manual for them.</li>
		<div class="subheader-text">Result and Discussion</div>
			<li>In this stage, we just implement three phase plastic extruder manufacturing process in this system. We recommend Southern Machinery can also implement their other products.</li>
			<li>After analyzing the task list in the Microsoft project, and inspecting the business process by our system, we decreased the total manufacturing by approximately 15%.</li>
			<li>Our team only optimized the assembly process because of the limited data Southern Machinery could give. We suggested Southern Machinery can also optimize their supply chain.</li>
